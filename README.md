## **1. Data Import and Initial Exploration**  
This phase involves loading the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, outliers, and key variables.

---

## **2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
Cleaning the data to ensure consistency and preparing it for analysis through techniques such as handling missing values and removing outliers.

---

## **3. Feature Engineering**  
Enhancing the dataset by creating, transforming, and selecting relevant features for modeling.

### **Normalization and Scaling**
